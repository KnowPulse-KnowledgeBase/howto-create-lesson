## Hello and Welcome! There is not very much setup for this tutorial -you just need a GitHub Account!

To sign-up, go to [Join GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). We recommend using your full name with no spaces or special characters as your username (e.g. laceyannesanderson) and using your university email. You can add multiple emails in the settings for your account to ensure you keep access once you graduate!

### What do you use GitHub for?

Github is a great, free place to keep track of any scripts you use for your research! We recommend that in addition to creating this tutorial, you use GitHub to keep track of all your data manipulation and scripts -this can help you write your methods for your thesis/manuscripts!
